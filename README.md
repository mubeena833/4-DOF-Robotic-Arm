# 4-DOF-Robotic-Arm
Arduino-based 4 DOF Robotic Arm using Servo Motors and Joystick Control
# 4-DOF Robotic Arm Project

## Project Theme
**"Precision and Automation in a Compact Robotic Arm"**  
This project focuses on designing and implementing a **4-DOF robotic arm** capable of performing precise pick-and-place operations. It emphasizes **manual control via joystick** as well as **programmable motion sequences**, providing a foundation for learning robotics, automation, and embedded system design.

---

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **4-DOF (Degrees of Freedom) robotic arm** controlled using an **Arduino Uno** and **servo motors**. The robotic arm can perform basic pick-and-place operations and movements based on joystick input or programmed sequences.  

This project is suitable for beginners in **robotics**, **embedded systems**, and **mechatronics**.
